I am a multifaceted professional who has\r\n            journeyed through diverse career paths, which help me to develop a\r\n            unique set of skills and experiences. For more than decade, I was\r\n            immersed in multiple roles in field of tourism. I roamed the Nepalâ€™s\r\n            most breathtaking landscapes as dedicated trekking guide. Guiding\r\n            adventurers through challenging terrains and sharing my passion for\r\n            nature, I was able to connect to the people from various faceted of\r\n            life. I got involved in management sector of tourism.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After that I transition into the realm of technology. My deep\r\n            interest in tech took me in tech field. I spend next four year in\r\n            architectural visualization (arch viz). During this time, I\r\n            transformed architectural concepts into 3d models. I worked for\r\n            Japanese firm (SR Design) that specialized in arch viz. I learned to\r\n            be detail oriented and be meticulous to create intricate 3d models.\r\n            As a team leader, I learn leadership and expertise were integral in\r\n            ensuring the successful execution of complex visualizations and\r\n            designs.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            I was interested in world of web. I learned front-end development. I\r\n            learned the art of crafting user-friendly and visually appealing\r\n            websites, combining my design sensibilities with my newfound\r\n            proficiency in HTML, CSS, and other key programming languages. My\r\n            journey, spanning from trekking guide to 3D modeling team leader and\r\n            front-end developer, has granted me a holistic perspective. I\r\n            understand the importance of both visual aesthetics and seamless\r\n            user experiences, whether it's guiding people through nature's\r\n            wonders or crafting intuitive digital interfaces.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            On this website, you'll discover the culmination of my passions and\r\n            expertise, reflecting my diverse journey.
